Hi there! I'm an artist and maker living in Los Angeles, you can visit my website at [wolfCatWorkshop.com](https://wolfcatworkshop.com). 

This is a collection of sketches where I explore coding that creates images I find interesting. I'm not an expert so [comments and suggestions](https://wolfcatworkshop.com/index.php/contact/) are always welcome. 

## Makevember Sketches

Makevember is a challenge to make one thing everyday in November. There is a longer [manifesto](https://chickengrylls.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/the-makevember-manifesto/) you should read but in short it proposes:

> **Every day in November make a thing** – if you can’t do it every day then do what you can, but the idea is to push yourself to work daily   and with less procrastination. Do not attempt to put your ducks in a row first.

In 2017 I made a bunch of little handcranked machines I documented [here](https://wolfcatworkshop.com/index.php/portfolio/one-month-small-machines/) but in 2018 I wanted to get a little bit out of my confort zone and explore some creative coding. As a begginer I think it makes sense to push myself to practice everyday while showing what I'm doing, which explains this collection of sketches. You can also find some of these images and what I did with them on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/wolfCatWorkshop) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wolfcatworkshop/).
