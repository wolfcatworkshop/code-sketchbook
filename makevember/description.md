Makevember is a challenge to make one thing everyday in November. There is a longer [manifesto](https://chickengrylls.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/the-makevember-manifesto/) you should read but in short it proposes:

> *Every day in November make a thing* – if you can’t do it every day then do what you can, but the idea is to push yourself to work daily >  and with less procrastination. Do not attempt to put your ducks in a row first.

In 2017 I made a bunch of little handcranked machines I documented [here](https://wolfcatworkshop.com/index.php/portfolio/one-month-small-machines/) but in 2018 I wanted to get a little bit out of my confort zone and explore some creative coding. As a begginer I think it makes sense to push myself to practice everyday while showing what I'm doing, which explains this collection of sketches.
